# Bouncing Smiley

This is a "game", written in C64 Basic, in which you can watch a smiley (and a frowney!) bounce around the screen. Yay!

## Usage

To "play" this "game", download [bouncing-smiley.prg][1] and then open it with the VICE C64 emulator.

## Building

To build this yourself, run `make` inside the project's root directory. You'll need to have Make, Python and the VICE emulator's `petcat` tool installed and in your path. After successful compilation, you'll end up with the file bouncing-smiley.prg, which you can then run in VICE's C64 emulator.

Alternatively you can run `make run` to build the "game" and open it in the emulator in one step.
